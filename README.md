# üçÖ Pomodoro üçÖ

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo[1] in the late 1980s.[2] The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for 'tomato', after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.  

## Assignment

Recreate the famous Pomodoro technique using React.  
This assignment is loosely described on purpose. You can either create a very basic, or a very advanced app.  
ALTOUGH, it should contain basic functionality, such as:

* Start a timer of 25 minutes
* After the timer runs out, switch it to a 5 minute break timer
* After the 5 minute timer runs out, switch it to the 25 minute job timer

A more detailed description of what the Pomodoro technique actually is can be [found here](https://lifehacker.com/productivity-101-a-primer-to-the-pomodoro-technique-1598992730) 

Here's also a list of other Pomodoro apps, which tou can take inspiration from:

* [Tomato Timer](https://tomato-timer.com/)
* [Focus Booster](https://www.focusboosterapp.com/)
* [Pomo Todo](https://pomotodo.com/?utm_source=zapier.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=zapier)
* [Marinara Timer](https://www.marinaratimer.com/?utm_source=zapier.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=zapier)

Remember, the diffuculty level is totally up to you, so feel free to experiment!
Good luck! üçÄ
